Multithread_Socket_Transmission
===============================

`A Client/Server program for transferring files by socket in linux/windows`

###1. If you are using windows 

It will be more simple to compile the code if you are using visual studio(I tested on vs10)

go to the top directory of client(or server) folder and double click the `.sln` file to build solution.
     
Note: how to test

For server :

double click server.exe 
     
For client: `(default port 5555)`

`in the command line`   ./client [server_IP/domain] [PORTNO(5555)] [Filepath]

###2. If you machine os is linux

See readme file in server/client folder

###Enjoy !
