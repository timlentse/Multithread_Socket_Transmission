   Building with GNU tools (Linux, *BSD, MacOS X, mingw, etc.)
          Generally these should be all that are needed to build the libraries,
          applications, and samples:

1. How to build(make sure automake ,libtool have been installed):

  Go to termimal:
   $  make

Note: it will generate executable file


2. Getting Start:
After step 1, you have your project built, and the following is to test.
In command line:
 
 if you are using server endpoint:
   ./server 


 if you are using client endpoint:(default port 5555)
   ./client [server_IP/domain] [PORTNO(5555)] [Filepath]


Notes: You should run the server endpoint first; if you have successfully run client part , the server will receive your file.
